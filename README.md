# waypoint-map

### Hello! I am UNT-terrablader11, and placed 6th during the April Student Qualifier this year! I hope that this repository helps you all create better models and hopefully win. 

# How To Use

### The code was written within Google Colaboratory, though it should be generalizable to all Python notebooks. Make sure to change the file names when using the code for organization. I got the data from the following repository: https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-race-data/tree/main/raw_data/tracks

### One issue I've been having is that some of the waypoints overlap. It seems to be a problem with the data itself rather than my code, but if anyone finds a solution, feel free to open a pull request.
