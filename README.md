# waypoint-map

##### Hello! I am UNT-terrablader11, and placed 6th during the April Student Qualifier this year! I hope that this repository helps you all create better models and hopefully win. 

# How To Use

##### The two .ipynb files are the code to generate the waypoint maps. Thanks to Hasarindu Perera, a much better racer than myself, for making the notebooks easier to read and also including a local version.

##### The tracks folder contains the NumPy arrays that contain the track waypoints in xy coordinate space. The maps folder contains the finished waypoint maps for your use, in .png format.

# Issues and Things to Do

##### One issue I've been having is that some of the waypoints overlap. It seems to be a problem with the data itself rather than my code, but if anyone finds a solution, feel free to open a pull request. 

##### I'm also hoping for this repository to be a place for all racers to share strategies, especially to counter the large amount of Chinese racers. If anyone is willing to share their strategies for success, upload them in a seperate folder for others to hopefully improve on them
